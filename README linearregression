📌 Project Overview
This project implements Simple Linear Regression to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience. The model is trained using historical salary data and can be used to estimate salaries for new employees.

📂 Dataset
File: Salary.csv
Columns:
YearsExperience (Independent variable)
Salary (Dependent variable)
🛠️ Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn (for model training and prediction)
🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Import the Required Libraries
 
2️⃣ Load the Dataset
 
3️⃣ Split the Data into Training & Testing Sets
 
4️⃣ Train the Simple Linear Regression Model
 
5️⃣ Predict the Test Set Results
 
6️⃣ Visualize the Training Set Results
 
7️⃣ Visualize the Test Set Results
 
8️⃣ Predict Salary for a Given Experience
 
📊 Output Example
 
Enter the number of years of experience: 7  
Predicted Salary for 7 years of experience: $89,853.60  
💡 Notes
Ensure Salary.csv is present in the same directory as the script.
The model uses 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
The random_state=0 ensures reproducibility.
The linear regression model is trained using scikit-learn.
📌 Next Steps
Improve accuracy using Polynomial Regression or Multiple Regression.
Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
