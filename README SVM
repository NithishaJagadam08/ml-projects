Project Overview
This project demonstrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification for predicting whether a person will purchase a car based on age and estimated salary. The dataset is processed using feature scaling, data splitting, and categorical encoding before training the SVM model. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores and a confusion matrix.
