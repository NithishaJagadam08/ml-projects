📈 Logistic Regression for Car Purchase Prediction

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates Logistic Regression to predict whether a customer will purchase a car based on factors such as age, salary, and credit score. The dataset car_purchase.csv contains financial and demographic data to help analyze customer purchasing behavior.

📂 Dataset
Ensure your dataset (car_purchase.csv) is structured as follows:

Age	Salary	Credit Score	Purchased
25	50000	650	0
30	60000	700	1
...	...	...	...
⚙️ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

 
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
📜 Code Explanation

1️⃣ Import Libraries

 
2️⃣ Load Dataset

 
3️⃣ Split Dataset into Training and Test Sets
 
4️⃣ Feature Scaling
 
5️⃣ Train Logistic Regression Model
 
6️⃣ Make Predictions on the Test Set

🎯 Expected Output
Example output of predicted vs actual purchase decisions:

Predicted Purchases: [0 1 0 1 1 ...]  
Actual Purchases:    [0 1 0 1 0 ...]  
📜 Notes

Logistic Regression is used for binary classification (0 or 1).
Feature scaling helps standardize input variables for better model performance.
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) for better evaluation.
