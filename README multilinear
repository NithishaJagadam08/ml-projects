📈 Multiple Linear Regression for Startup Success Prediction
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates Multiple Linear Regression to predict the success of startups based on various factors such as R&D Spend, Administration Cost, Marketing Spend, and State. The dataset Successful_Startups.csv contains financial data to help analyze and forecast startup profits.

📂 Dataset
Ensure your dataset (Successful_Startups.csv) is structured as follows:

R&D Spend	Administration	Marketing Spend	State	Profit
165349.2	136897.8	471784.1	California	192261.83
162597.7	151377.59	443898.53	Florida	191792.06
...	...	...	...	...
⚙️ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
📜 Code Explanation
1️⃣ Import Libraries
 
2️⃣ Load Dataset
 
3️⃣ Encode Categorical Data (State Column)
 
4️⃣ Split Dataset into Training and Test Sets
 
5️⃣ Train Multiple Linear Regression
 
6️⃣ Make Predictions on the Test Set
 
🎯 Expected Output
Example output of predicted vs actual profits:
  
Predicted Profits: [103015.20 132582.27 132447.73 71976.09 178537.48 ...]
Actual Profits:    [103282.38 144259.40 146121.95 77798.83 191050.39 ...]
📜 Notes
Multiple Linear Regression helps predict a dependent variable (profit) based on multiple independent variables.
One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical variables (State) into numerical form.
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) for better evaluation.
