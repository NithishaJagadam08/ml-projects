📌 Project Overview
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm to predict whether a customer will purchase a car based on their age and estimated salary.

📂 Dataset
File: car_purchase_data.csv
Columns:
Age (Independent variable)
Estimated Salary (Independent variable)
Purchased (Dependent variable: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)
🛠️ Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn (for model training and evaluation)
🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Import Required Libraries

2️⃣ Load the Dataset
 
4️⃣ Feature Scaling
 
5️⃣ Train the K-NN Model
 
classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)
6️⃣ Predict a New Result
 
7️⃣ Predict the Test Set Results
 
8️⃣ Evaluate the Model Using a Confusion Matrix
 
9️⃣ Visualize the Training Set Results
 
🔟 Visualize the Test Set Results
 
📊 Output Example
Model Accuracy
 
[[55  3]
 [ 1 21]]
Model Accuracy: 0.95
Prediction for New Data
 
Input: Age = 22, Salary = 40000  
Output: 0 (No Purchase)
💡 Notes
Ensure car_purchase_data.csv is in the same directory as the script.
The model uses 80% training data and 20% testing data.
The K-value (neighbors) is set to 5 using the Euclidean distance metric (p=2).
The confusion matrix evaluates the performance of the model.
📌 Next Steps
Tune hyperparameters (K-value, metric, weights) for better accuracy.
Try different classification algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
