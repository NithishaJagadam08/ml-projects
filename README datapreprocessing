Project Overview
This project demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques required for machine learning models. It includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, splitting datasets, and feature scaling using Python and Scikit-Learn. The dataset used contains country names, age, estimated salary, and a target variable indicating a binary classification outcome (Yes/No).

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

 
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Steps Included in the Script
1. Importing Required Libraries
 
2. Importing the Dataset
 
3. Handling Missing Data
 
4. Encoding Categorical Data
4.1 Encoding Independent Variables
4.2 Encoding Dependent Variables
 
5. Splitting the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
 
6. Feature Scaling
 
Expected Output
Preprocessed dataset with missing values handled, categorical data encoded, and features scaled.
Training and testing sets ready for model training.
How to Run
Download or clone the repository.
Run the script in Google Colab or any Python environment.
Check the outputs for transformed datasets.
