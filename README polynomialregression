Polynomial Regression for Corn Yield Prediction
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression to predict corn yield based on fertilizer usage. The dataset Corn_Yield.csv contains information on fertilizer usage and its effect on crop yield.

📂 Dataset
Ensure your dataset (Corn_Yield.csv) is structured as follows:

Fertilizer Used	Corn Yield
1.0	10.5
2.0	15.3
...	...
⚙️ Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:
